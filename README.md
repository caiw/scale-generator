# Scale Generator: explore partitions of an octave

Scale Generator is a Python program which generates and filters musical scales.

## Scales and partitions

For the purposes of this program we'll consider a scale to be a partition of an octave using semitones, with an octave being a 12-semitone interval.  So Scale Generator represents a scale as a list of intervals, each measured in semitones.

For example, let's look at everyone's first scale, C-major:

> C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C

This the major scale:

> R, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, R'

in the key of C, where we use R to mean the root note of the scale, and the M-numbers for the intervals musicians will typically be familiar with (M2 is a "major second").

We could also represent the same scale as a list of tones and semitones:

> t, t, s, t, t, t, s

or equivalently, since we're treating a semitone as our smallest interval, as a list of numbers describing the number of semitones in each interval:

> `[2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`

This will be how we manipulate scales in this program:  as lists of numbers describing intervals, where a number describes the width of the interval in semitones, and where the list adds up to `12` (an octave).

## Notation in this document

As you'll have seen, we're now using numbers to mean two things:  numbers of semitones in an interval, and the interval's "name" as conventionally used.  These aren't the same, so for example a major 4th (M4) has `5` semitones; a flat 7th (â™­7) has `10` semitones in it.

As an attempt to disambiguate, I'll try to use a `fixed-width typeface` for semitone-measured intervals.  (Unless I'm showing code output, in which case it will always be `fixed-width`, just to make things confusing.  Sorry.)

Basically everything from now on will be related to computer code, and so will used `fixed-with`, and refer to semitone-measured intervals.

## What the program does

The basic things Scale Generator does are:

- Produce a list of all possible scales (partitions of an octave with intervals).
- Present various options to filter the list.
- Display the scales.
- Generate MIDI files of the scales.

At the moment, the filtering options are:

- Filter out scales with long chromatic segments.
- Filter out scales which are cyclic permutations (modes) of other scales.
- Filter out scales which are "subscales" of other scales, found by taking an existing scale and removing some notes.
- Filter out scales which are over a certain length.
- Filter out scales which contain intervals over a certain size.

## How to use it

### Basic use

[Download](https://github.com/caiw/scale-generator/archive/master.zip) and uncompress the code.  The code lives in `scale_generator.py`.  To use it, make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

Then, in a command line, navigate to where you downloaded it, run

	python3 scale_generator.py
	
This will produce a list of scales, ordered by length, with a bit of extra information.  Each line of the output looks like:

	<timestamp>	[number in list]	[length]	[scale as interval sequence]	[scale as note sequence]
	
For example, the first few lines should be:

	1	1	[12]	['R', 'R']
	2	2	[1, 11]	['R', 'm2', 'R']
	3	2	[2, 10]	['R', 'M2', 'R']
	...
	1361	7	[2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]	['R', 'M2', 'M3', 'M4', 'M5', 'M6', 'M7', 'R']
	...
	
So on that 1361st line, you'll see the major scale, written both as the interval list `[2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and the note sequence R, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, R; just as we had it before.

### Output options

To save the output to a text file, just do as you would ordinarily in your command line:

	python3 scale_generator.py > ~/Desktop/scales.txt
	
To generate MIDI files, specify the path in following command line argument:

	--save_midi+to /path/for/midi/files/
	
For example:

	python3 scale_generator.py --save_midi_to /Users/cai/Desktop/scales/
	
will save MIDI files to a directory called "`scales`" on my Desktop, which I should create in advance.

Files will be named after the scale in the interval-list format, e.g. `scale-[2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1].mid`.

### Filtering options

The following filtering switches can be used, which will remove entries from the list.  This allows you to alter what you mean by "scale" and "different".

`--filter_modes`
: Every scale can be transformed into different modes, which are cyclic permutations of the same scale.  So if the scale
:>	C, D, E, F, G, A, B
: is the C-major scale, then
:>	A, B, C, D, E, F, G
: is also the C-major scale, but starting on the 6th note.  This particular mode is known as the Aeolian or VI mode.
: You might, as a musician, not consider these scales to be "different", and so using this switch will only show one out of each of the modes of a scale.

`--filter_chromatic_triplets`
: The chromatic scale is the one with all the notes; twelve semitones. In our case that's `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
: When you hear several semitones in a row, it sounds chromatic.  It can sound like a scale with a chromatic segment inserted into it.
: For this reason it's possible to filter out scales which have three or more chromatic notes in sequence.  This is the same as filtering out sequences of intervals which have `[1, 1]` in the list.  This also includes lists which both begin and end with `1`, which would have a chromatic triplet if played in a different mode, or over two octaves.
: Use this switch to exclude such scales.

`--filter_subscales`
: If I play a scale, and then play it again but just miss out some of the notes, is that really a new scale?
: If you don't think so, use this switch.

`--max_interval N`
: If my scale has a two notes separated by a perfect 5th, or a full octave, it doesn't necessarily sound like a scale.  You can specify the largest interval of `N` semitones permitted between two consecutive notes using this.
: For example, `-max_interval 4` means you won't get anything larger than a major third in your scale.

`--min_length N`
: This is another way to achieve something similar. If your scale only has two notes in it, it doesn't sound very scale-like.
: For example, `-min_length 6` will give you only scales with at least 6 notes in them.

## Notes about filtering

### See what's filtered

You can use `--verbose_filtering` to log what's being filtered out.

### Filter ordering matters!

For example, _just_ use `--filter_subscales`, and you get only one scale:

> `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

since every scale is a subscale of the chromatic scale.

But using `--filter_subscales` _and_ `--filter_chomatic_triplets` gives you 33 scales.

This only works because we filter chromatic triplets before we filter subscales.  By filtering chromatic triplets first, the `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` scale is removed, and so it doesn't consume every other scale as a subscale.  If instead we filtered subscales first, we'd get down to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and then filter that out as having chromatic triplets, leaving none at all.

So the this program applies its filters is:

1. Chromatic triplets.
2. Subscales.
3. Modes.
4. Maximum interval.
5. Minimum length.

(This ordering happens internally, it doesn't matter what order you give the switches in.)
